# This is a version of Space Invaders but with some Star Wars tweaks.

# Currently working on adding new ships. You start with the x-wing and you can work your way up the line, with iconic options like the Millenium Falcon or the Razor Crest.

# In addition, powerups/abilities are being worked on.


# Hope you enjoy!

# NOTE: quad cannon laser ability [2 hit] variable problems exist. Hopefully will be fixed in later commits
